4. Name three rails generator commands. What is created by each?

  Your answer:

  rails generate Model- The generate Model command allows you to create a new model. This model is a table which includes column with data types. 

  rails generate Migration- Rails migrations allows you to make changes to your schema, without directly changing it on the file. It makes it possible to use a version control system since each migration is time stamped.

  rails generate Controller- This rails command creates a controller, which is able to retrieve information the Model and send it to the View. You can define what the controller name will be in the rails command.


  Researched answer:

  rails generate Model- Allows for Rails to create a model class, which can add database records, find particular data you're looking for, update that data, or remove data.

  rails generate Migration- Rails Migration allows you to use Ruby to define changes to your database schema, making it possible to use a version control system to keep things synchronized with the actual code.

  rails generate Controller- A controller's purpose is to receive specific requests for the application. Routing decides which controller receives which requests. Often, there is more than one route to each controller, and different routes can be served by different actions. Each action's purpose is to collect information to provide it to a view.
